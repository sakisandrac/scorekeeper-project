# Ping Pong Score Keeper

## Abstract:
Ping Pong Score Keeper is an application that keeps track of scores for users who are playing a two person game. Users can select up to how many games they want to play and keep track of each player's score, incrementing by one. When the amount of games selected is reached, the winner's score will change to green and the loser's to red. This application can be used for any game where you will need to keep track of single scores.

## Context:
- I created this project after about 2 weeks of learning in the Udemy Web Development course by Colt Steele. It took about 4-5 hours to complete. This was my first project I've ever done combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Contributors:
- [Saki Chatphatthanasiri](https://github.com/sakisandrac)

## Learning Goals:
- Practice writing JavaScript logic
- Add basic CSS styling

## Wins + Challenges:
### Wins:
- My biggest win was being able to figure out the JS logic on my own when adding counting the scores. As this was my first project, I am very happy that I was able to figure it out.

### Challenges:
- The biggest challenge was figuring out how to combine all my knowledge that I've learned to far through Udemy. Usually I code along to the lessons but this time I wanted to figure out how to match the comp on my own without seeing anyone elses code.
